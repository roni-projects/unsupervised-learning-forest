# Clustering Analysis on the Forest Cover Dataset ðŸŒ²

This project was developed as part of a university course on **Unsupervised Learning**.

## Project Objective
We used a labeled dataset ("Forest CoverType") â€“ but **intentionally ignored the labels** during the analysis.  
The goal was to apply various unsupervised learning techniques, including:
- Clustering (e.g., KMeans, DBSCAN)
- Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA)
- Clustering Quality Metrics (e.g., Silhouette Score)

After clustering, we compared the resulting clusters to the true labels to evaluate how well the algorithms captured meaningful structures in the data.

## How to Run
1. Download the original dataset file `covtype.csv` from Kaggle:  
   ðŸ‘‰ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/forest-cover-type-dataset  
   *(The file is too large to be included in the repository.)*
2. Place the file in the root directory of the project.
3. Run the notebook (`.ipynb`) or script (`.py`) to:
   - Preprocess the data
   - Apply clustering
   - Export results and visualizations

**Note**: The files included in this repo (such as `sampled_data.csv`) are outputs generated from a specific sample used in my analysis.  
If you prefer to work on the full dataset or generate your own sample, feel free to do so.  
There is also a dedicated section in the code that performs normalization on the full dataset â€“ you can run it yourself to reproduce or customize your own version. (#Data loading and normalization)
ðŸ“Œ If you choose to generate your own outputs from the full dataset, it's recommended to give them different file names.  
   This helps avoid confusion or overwriting the sample-based files that are already included in this repository.

##  Key Files

- `sampled_data.csv` â€“ A representative sample of 10,000 rows (without labels), constructed to reflect the original data distribution. Useful for faster testing or demonstrations.

- `clustering_performance_results.csv` â€“ A summary table showing the performance of different clustering methods (e.g., KMeans, DBSCAN), including metrics like Silhouette Score and number of clusters.

- `comparison_clusters_pca_vs_normalized.xlsx` â€“ An Excel file containing:
  - The original `Cover_Type` labels
  - Cluster labels produced by KMeans on normalized features
  - Cluster labels after applying PCA followed by KMeans  
  This enables a clear comparison between methods and clustering quality.

The written report includes:
- Abstract
- Methodology
- Results & Evaluation
- Conclusions
- **Discussion**: An analysis of the gaps between clustering results and true labels, and insights about the clustering quality.
